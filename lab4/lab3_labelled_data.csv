Is can can we can be categorized as a margin which is the. Margin of error basically. ",133,7,answer,TRUE
"OK, Sir, Sir. Inheritance is basically, Sir, when you are having a class, let's say. Like inheritance in the common sense of the word is basically when you're inheriting. When you're when you're taking ownership of properties or properties or wealth or whatever you want to consider from your fathers and for fathers. But in the oops paradigm of it, when you're having a class which is defined or. A function which. Is defined and it is performing its. Performing a certain set of tasks, but you're but you're calling that function with a different set of inputs. To augment or to change to augment, or to change the in the the function like the function, the initial the parent function is doing its task as it is, but you're calling it inside a child function where the child function is basically taking in the methods, the inputs and the inputs of the parent. Function and is able to is able to give you the input outputs which the parent function provides and you may be and you will be able to augment it without disturbing the parent function. ",189,8,answer,TRUE
"Set an example. OK, fine. Right now will be, Sir, if you are. Will like if it is something. So if you're having a, if you're having a function which is basically taking an input and adding it and giving it, giving you a return of the summed value. And you're calling and you're inheriting that function into another class. You're where the inputs are the same, but you're calling the function again, so you are going to take the inputs, which is provided to this new class as the inputs to the original class, and you're returning the sum as the return function for the new class, which is taken. Along with any other new operations which you wish to wish to wish to do on the newer class. For example, you can multiply the two numbers or you can subtract the two numbers and provide it as an additional return. ",152,5,answer,TRUE

It's a Fourier transform. Is like an operation like kind of an operation that helps us convert. Signals from like. The time domain to the frequency domain. ,27,0,answer,TRUE
"So because in time domain, what we can analyze from the signals is only loudness, but converting it to a frequency domain or like converting it to a spectrum helps us analyze better when it comes. To signals. ",38,2,answer,TRUE
"So because when we have a spectrum, a spectrum is basically frequency over. I mean there are frequency components in the spectrum. It's it's basically in the frequency domain, so. We we can get different other values like parameters that can help us analyze not only loudness. ",47,1,answer,TRUE
Fourier transform. So basically I would say that it's like a very specific thing like when we have Laplace transform that can convert time domain to any other. Domain like it's. It can only convert a frequency domain I think. ,40,1,answer,TRUE
"It's a short time Fourier transform is what we apply on very small frames and in short time Fourier transform. The assumption is that the components are stationary because we we take very small time slots, so it's assumed that the components are stationary at a given particular time. That this is short time for transform, but Fourier transform is applied on the complete signal. ",65,1,answer,TRUE
"A short time Fourier transform is more efficient. No. So computationally I think Fourier transform because there's no breaking down of segments and all. It's just directly applying. On the full signal, that's why. ",34,0,answer,TRUE
Yes. ,1,0,answer,TRUE
Yes. ,1,0,answer,TRUE
"So when we analyze the full signal at once and like when we talk about speech, it's like a container signal. It's very hard to like apply for like we consider it to be an infinite it of infinite length, so it's very hard for us to apply like Fourier transform to the full sequence. That's why we divide it into. Frames. And analyze and that to survive is the speech signal is not stationary, it keeps changing. So it's very hard to apply Fourier transform directly",87,3,answer,TRUE
That is like one of the reason also because it's we we considered to be infinitely long. So it's very hard to apply Fourier transform on the whole signal at once and it it's hard to analyze. Also when you have such large amount of data and like all at once. ,51,1,answer,TRUE
"Yes, and neurons. But yeah, neurons. ",6,0,answer,TRUE
"Sir, the neuron, like one neuron alone, cannot do because like one neuron has inputs and it gives us. An output but.
