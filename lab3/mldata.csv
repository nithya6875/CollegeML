,,So you know what is short time Fourier transform.,"Yes, Sir.",you know what is short time Fourier transform.,"Yes, Sir."
,,What is it?,"A short time Fourier transform of the understanding. The reason it came behind the reason it came was because in a frequency of a speech.There, there's no constant frequency or constant intensity is always a varying range of frequencies when you're speaking. So when you're going to do a forget transfer of the whole signal, you lose out on many temporal characteristics of the speech.Which which basically reduces the accuracy of your model later on. So instead of doing a Fourier transform on the whole signal, we divide it into parts or the windows. So that's how the word short time for your transform came. So it takes short short windows of the same frequency and then transforms it onto the spectral domain.",What is it?,"A short time Fourier transform of the understanding.

,,"Right. OK, so I'll ask you some probability related questions, OK. ",Sure sir,,
,,You remember what is the Bayes theorem? ,"Yes, Sir. ",You remember what is the Bayes theorem? ,"Yes, Sir. "
,,Can you tell me what it is? ,"So baye's theorem. Basically it is coming down to. It is saying that when when you're taking a probability distribution or probability curve that. The probability the dependencies of the probability, like if you're taking. Uh. Is it if you're having a conditional probability? Basically, if A is given so that B is given, you're taking it such that probability of a given B probability of a given B is the probability of a by probability of a divided by probability of B. It's a whatever. It basically talks about you having the knowledge of. And you having the information of the prior event which has occurred so that you can find the probability of the event which is occurring in the future. ",Can you tell me what it is? ,"So baye's theorem.

,,"If you want it you, you can. If you want, you can probably write it and then probably tell it. That's also fine. ","Yeah.So basically when it comes down to it is, you will have probability of. E given A is equal to the probability of the call. E / E divided by probability of the probability of E given a divided by probability of. Probably. If a into probability of a divided by the probability of a. So when you're having two events where one is related to the other, you're taking the probability of two the two independent events dividing it by the probability of the initial event happening.

,,"So you are saying if and we are independent, they won't influence each other? ","Yeah, because like if A&B are happening are have are, are independent and you're saying that A has happened.

,,"OK, very good. So what will be the joint probability? Of A&B in this situation. ","In a situation where Sir A has already happened, a will be 100%. ", So what will be the joint probability? Of A&B in this situation. ,"In a situation where Sir A has already happened, a will be 100%. "

,,"Very good. Yeah, that is right. No, that is right because the conditional probability doesn't exist, it becomes the probability of each event independently","Yes, Sir. "," that is right because the conditional probability doesn't exist, it becomes the probability of each event independently",
,,"Very well. Now, can you tell me now? How does this? Conditional probability.

7,7,Yeah.So tell me. How is a convolution neural network different from a Regular fully connected neural network. ,"Sir, it depends on the differences.

Is it more of a airwave or is it an electromagnetic wave? Or what is it? How does it go? ","Yes, Sir. It is. We are surrounded by air and it is through airway and but if you are speaking through the yeah, yes it is. It is Airways, it is Airways. It is based upon airway propagation. "
,,Suppose you and your friend. You going to space where there is no air. Would you be able to speak to each other? ,"No, Sir, we won't be able to speak. We would be able to speak if we have special devices which transmits the electromagnetic wave like a telephone or a like a like a walkie-talkie or something. ",Suppose you and your friend.

,,"Very good. So I mean, we have different consonant, the four themes which basically come from consent. Sound and then we have 4 names which come from which represent the vowel sounds OK. ","Yes, Sir. Yes, yes, Sir.","so I mean, we have different consonant, the four themes which basically come from consent.

,,How how do you? How would you differentiate between? Suppose you are looking at only the spectral properties of a sound. Would you be able to make out whether it is a vowel sound or it is a consonant sound? ,"Yes, surely I would be able to make it make the difference out of it for let's say if you take a verbal verbals used to have high frequency and low energy and verbals, duration is considerably time duration is larger than that of consonants. That's how we differentiate. May the differentiate using the using the spectrum of the wave of waveform. ",How how do you? How would you differentiate between?

,,OK. Thank you very much.,"Sure, Sir.",,
,,So. Ohh stop the recording.,,,
